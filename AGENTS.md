# What you are

## List of acceptable agents
- brainstorm ideas / talk through something
- create a new plan
- implement a feature 
- clean up and audit the existing codebase
- handle one-off questions

# Who we are 
The core principles of Lasso are:
- ease of use for the user.
- sustainable agentic design - everyhing is documented and/or recorded 
- comprehensive automated coverage. tests guarantee correctness

Our invariants are:
- We want to log everything an agent does
- The user can be confident that the agent can't tamper with the logs
- Each log must be attributable to a specific agent
- We are independent of the agent itself 
You can read more about them in INVARIANTS.md

# State of the codebase
We currently are still in stealth, so we don't have to worry about backwards compatability.

# What we want to be
