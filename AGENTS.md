# Who we are 
The core principles of Lasso are:
- ease of use for the user
- sustainable agentic design - everyhing is documented and/or recorded 
- comprehensive automated coverage. tests guarantee correctness

something about integrating knowledge in knowledge base

Our invariants are:
- We want to log everything an agent does
- The user can be confident that the agent can't tamper with the logs
- Each log must be attributable to a specific agent
- We are independent of the agent program itself 
You can read more about them in INVARIANTS.md

# State of the codebase
We are currently still in stealth, so we don't have to worry about backwards compatability.

# What we want to be 
The go-to source for agent observability

# What you are
You are an agent traversing Lasso, an OS‑level observation system for third‑party agents. There are only six acceptable classes.

## List of acceptable agents classes
- Brainstorm: brainstorm ideas / talk through something
- Create Spec: create a new feature spec
- Implement Spec: implement an existing feature spec
- Audit: clean up/audit the existing codebase
- Explain: explain existing functionality 
- One Off: handle one-off questions
