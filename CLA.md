# Lux Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you ("You") and Page Mill Applied Intelligence (the "Company"), steward of the Lux project (the "Project"), for the contributions You submit to the Project.

By submitting a pull request, patch, issue comment containing code, documentation, or any other material to this repository, You agree to the terms of this Agreement.

## 1. Definitions

"Contribution" means any work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Project for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the Project. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on GitHub, email, and issue trackers.

## 2. Copyright License

You grant to the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

You retain ownership of Your Contributions, subject to the rights granted in this Agreement.

## 3. Patent License

You grant to the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Project to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) alleging that the Project or a Contribution incorporated within the Project constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 4. Outbound License and Relicensing

You understand that the Company distributes Project code under an open source license (currently `AGPL-3.0-only`).

In addition to distributing Contributions under the Project's open source license, the copyright and patent licenses You grant in this Agreement allow the Company to distribute and sublicense Your Contributions under other license terms (including proprietary/commercial licenses).

## 5. Your Representations

You represent that:

- You are legally entitled to grant the licenses in this Agreement.
- Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (or You have sufficient rights to submit it under this Agreement).
- To the best of Your knowledge, Your Contributions do not knowingly include third-party code or other material under terms that would conflict with the Project's license and this Agreement.

## 6. Disclaimer

Except as expressly stated in this Agreement, Your Contributions are provided "AS IS", without warranties or conditions of any kind.
