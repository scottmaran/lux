# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in the Lux
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Taking responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes.
- Focusing on what is best for the overall community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information (such as a physical or email address)
  without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of
acceptable behavior and will take fair corrective action in response to any
behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons
for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an
individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Reporting and Enforcement

To report Code of Conduct violations, use the private reporting path described
in `SECURITY.md` and prefix the report title with `[CoC]`.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
Maintainers will respect reporter privacy to the extent possible.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers may use these community impact guidelines in determining
consequences for violations:

1. Correction: private, written warning and request to stop the behavior.
2. Warning: explicit notice with consequences for repeated behavior.
3. Temporary ban: temporary suspension from project interaction.
4. Permanent ban: permanent suspension from project spaces.
