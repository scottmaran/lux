# Specs

Specs define intended behavior and design for non-trivial changes. They are
written before implementation and are kept up to date as the contract evolves.

## Naming
- `docs/specs/<slug>.md`

## Relationship To Tests
Acceptance criteria must be expressible as observable outcomes and should be
enforced by tests. See `tests/README.md`.

## Template
Start from `docs/specs/TEMPLATE.md`.
